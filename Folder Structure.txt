Explanation:
navigation folder:

AppNavigator.js: Configuration for React Navigation, defining your app's navigation structure.
redux folder:

actions folder: Contains action creators for Redux.

authActions.js: Actions related to authentication.
cartActions.js: Actions related to the shopping cart.
cropActions.js: Actions related to crop information.
reducers folder: Contains Redux reducers.

authReducer.js: Reducer for handling authentication-related state.
cartReducer.js: Reducer for handling shopping cart state.
cropReducer.js: Reducer for handling crop information state.
store.js: Configures the Redux store and combines reducers.

Integrating Redux:
Install Redux and React-Redux:

bash
Copy code
npm install redux react-redux
Create Redux Actions and Reducers:
Define your actions in authActions.js, cartActions.js, and cropActions.js. Implement corresponding reducers in authReducer.js, cartReducer.js, and cropReducer.js.

Create Redux Store:
Configure your Redux store in store.js using combineReducers and createStore. Also, apply middleware if needed (e.g., redux-thunk for handling asynchronous actions).

Connect Components to Redux:
Use the connect function from react-redux to connect your components to the Redux store. Dispatch actions from your components when needed.

Integrating React Navigation:
Install React Navigation:

bash
Copy code
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
Set Up Navigation:
Configure your app's navigation in AppNavigator.js using createStackNavigator or other navigators provided by React Navigation.

Connect Navigation to Redux:
If you need to dispatch navigation actions from your Redux actions or reducers, you might want to integrate a navigation service or middleware. The react-navigation library provides NavigationActions for this purpose.

Navigate Between Screens:
Use the navigation prop provided by React Navigation to navigate between screens.
